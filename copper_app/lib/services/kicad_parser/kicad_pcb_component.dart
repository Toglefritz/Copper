/// Represents a single component (a.k.a. footprint or module) within a KiCAD PCB design.
///
/// In KiCAD, components such as resistors, capacitors, integrated circuits, and connectors are represented as
/// **components/footprints/modules**. Each component contains data such as its name, position on the board, and the
/// layer on which it is placed. This class provides a structured way to store and interact with component data
/// extracted from a KiCAD PCB file.
///
/// ## Purpose:
/// - Stores detailed information about each component in the PCB layout.
/// - Provides an interface for retrieving component-specific attributes like position (`x`, `y`) and the layer to which
///   it belongs.
/// - Acts as a building block in the parsed representation of the PCB design.
///
/// ## Usage:
/// The `KiCadPCBComponent` class is instantiated through the `KiCadPCBComponent.fromSExpr` factory method, which
/// processes parsed S-Expression data extracted from the `.kicad_pcb` file. It is primarily used by the
/// `KiCadPCBDesign` class to manage and access all components in the design.
// ignore_for_file: avoid_dynamic_calls

  /// - `"B.Cu"`: Back copper layer (bottom side of the board).
