/// Represents a single pad of a component in a KiCAD PCB design.
///
/// In KiCAD, a **pad** is a connection point on a component that allows electrical signals to be routed between
/// components on a printed circuit board. Pads are typically used for through-hole components or surface-mount
/// components that require soldering to the board. This class provides a structured way to store and interact with
/// pad data extracted from a KiCAD PCB file.
///
/// Among other information, pads store the pad number, the pad type (e.g., `smd`, `thru_hole`), and the net connection
/// associated with the pad. This information is essential for routing connections between components and ensuring
/// proper electrical connectivity in the PCB design.
// ignore_for_file: avoid_dynamic_calls

  /// KiCAD assigns each pad a numerical code, which serves as an internal reference. This code is used to
  /// differentiate between different pads and helps in organizing electrical connections. Note that this identifier
  /// is unique within a particular component. Different components may have pads with the same identifier.

  /// - `smd`: Surface-mount device pad.
  /// - `thru_hole`: Through-hole pad.

  /// - `connect`: Connection pad (e.g., for test points).

  ///
  /// The net connection represents the electrical signal or connection to which the pad is linked. This connection
  /// helps in routing signals between components on the PCB. The net is identified by its name or code, which is
  /// used to establish electrical connectivity in the design. If multiple pads have connections to the same net,
  /// they are considered part of the same electrical network. In other words, pads with nets of the same name are
  /// connected to each other.
